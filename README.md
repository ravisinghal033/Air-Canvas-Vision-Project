# Air-Canvas-Vision-Project
<b>Computer Vision Library<b>:   - Used the computer vision library OpenCV to process the video feed. Applied image processing techniques for hand detection and tracking.
<b> Hand Gesture Recognition Algorithm<b>:   - Implemented an algorithm to recognize hand gestures. This involved machine learning techniques, such as training a model to classify different hand gestures.
<b>Digital Annotation Software<b>:   - Integrated a digital drawing or annotation software that allows the system to interpret hand gestures and draw on the screen.
<b>Communication Interface<b>:   - Established a communication interface between the hand gesture recognition module and the digital drawing software. This was achieved through APIs or custom protocols.
<b>User Interface (UI)<b>:   - Developed a user interface that enables users to switch between different drawing tools, colors, and erase functions using specific hand gestures.
